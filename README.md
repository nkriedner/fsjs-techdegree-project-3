This is my version of the "**Interactive Form**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree**.

The task was to use JavaScript and Regex to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

-   Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
-   Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

For the "Exceeds Expectation" grade I added:

-   real-time error-messaging to the credit-card input field
-   different error messsages depending on the credit-card number input (for empty fields, input with non-digit characters and for inputs that have less or more than 13-16 digits)

Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.
